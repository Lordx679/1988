# LORDX679 Digital Portfolio - Project Documentation

## Project Overview
A highly adaptive digital portfolio showcasing professional identity with dynamic theming, advanced file management, and modern web technologies. Built with React, Express.js, and optimized for Netlify deployment.

## Recent Changes (August 5, 2025)
- ✅ Added advanced file uploader with drag-and-drop functionality
- ✅ Fixed RTL text display issues for proper Arabic text rendering
- ✅ Prepared complete Netlify deployment configuration
- ✅ Created comprehensive GitHub deployment guide
- ✅ Built and tested production-ready bundle
- ✅ Added professional README and documentation

## Project Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Main Components**:
  - `DynamicApp.tsx`: Main portfolio application with sections
  - `FileUploader.tsx`: Advanced file management system
  - `AvatarUploader.tsx`: Discord avatar integration
  - `ColorThemeController.tsx`: Dynamic color theming

- **Key Features**:
  - Dynamic color extraction from avatar images
  - Responsive design with dark theme
  - Arabic language support (LTR layout)
  - File upload with preview and management
  - Discord API integration for avatars

### Backend (Express.js)
- **API Endpoints**:
  - `/api/discord-avatar`: Discord avatar fetching with fallbacks
- **Netlify Functions**: Converted Express routes for serverless deployment

### Database
- PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (optional, for future extensions)

## Deployment Configuration

### Netlify Setup
- `netlify.toml`: Build and redirect configuration
- `netlify/functions/api.js`: Serverless API functions
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Publish directory: `dist/public`

### Environment Variables
- `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Optional for real Discord avatar display
- `DISCORD_AVATAR_HASH`: Optional avatar hash fallback
- `DATABASE_URL`: Optional database connection

## User Preferences
- **Language**: Mixed Arabic and English content
- **Design**: Dark theme with dynamic colors and modern animations
- **Features**: File management capabilities were specifically requested
- **Deployment**: Netlify hosting preference

## Technical Decisions
- **Text Direction**: Changed from RTL to LTR for better text display
- **File Storage**: Client-side file handling with URL.createObjectURL
- **API Strategy**: Multiple fallback methods for Discord avatar fetching
- **Build Process**: Vite for frontend, esbuild for backend bundling

## Known Issues & Solutions
- ✅ Fixed: Text appearing reversed (RTL → LTR conversion)
- ✅ Fixed: Tailwind RTL spacing classes removed
- ✅ Tested: Production build successful (177KB gzipped)

## Next Steps for User
1. Create GitHub repository
2. Upload project files (excluding node_modules)
3. Deploy to Netlify using provided configuration
4. Optional: Add environment variables for Discord integration
